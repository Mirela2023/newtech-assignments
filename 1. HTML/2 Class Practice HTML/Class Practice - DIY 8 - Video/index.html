        Earth — our home planet — is the only place we know of so far that’s
        inhabited by living things. It's also the only planet in our solar
        system with liquid water on the surface. While Earth is only the fifth
        largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar
        system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than
        nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the
        Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. <br />Earth is the only
        planet in the Solar System whose English name does not come from Greek
        or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It
        simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many names for our
        planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third
        planet from the Sun.
