        Music consists of a combination of three core components: melody,
        harmony, and rhythm. A songâ€™s rhythmic structure dictates when notes are
        played, for how long, and with what degree of emphasis. <br />
        Rhythm is the pattern of sound, silence, and emphasis in a song. In
        music theory, rhythm refers to the recurrence of notes and rests
        (silences) in time. When a series of notes and rests repeats, it forms a
        rhythmic pattern. In addition to indicating when notes are played,
        musical rhythm also stipulates how long they are played and with what
        intensity. This creates different note durations and different types of
        accents.
